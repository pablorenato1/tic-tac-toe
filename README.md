# Tic-tac-toe

<p> 
A tic-tac-toe game is one of the most commom games in the childhood and i did this one so that i can practice what i learn and also improving what i think is a good addition to the game.

  When first open the game the first thing that the user is going to see is the start menu.<br>
  Where the user can choose between play versus a friend or a algorithm that will randomly choose.
